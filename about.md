## Background

Welcome! I'm currently a senior at Brigham Young University studying Statistics and Computer Science.
My obsession with analyzing how complex processess and relationships in the mathemetical sciences explain our world
eventually drew me to study relevant metholodogies whose principles can be programmed, optimized, and scaled.
I've enjoyed leveraging this knowledge to engineer solutions in accessibility, education, healthcare, marketing, 
and economics. My passion for continual learning enhances this expertise, and  opportunities to make meaningful contributions in these areas and others always excites me.

## Education

- **Brigham Young University**
    - **B.S. in Statistics & Computer Science** — 2026
        - **Minor**: Mathematics
- **Relevant Coursework**: Probability & Inference 2, Software Design, Statistical Modeling 2, Algorithm Design & Analysis, Machine Learning Operations (MLOps), Advanced Software Construction, Multivariable Calculus, Mathematics of Data Science

## Experience

### Professional Work
- **Research Assitant - Record Linking Lab**
    - Designed and implemented a scalable microservice in Python using AWS server technology, automating relevant data indexing and facilitating record linking processes.
    - Devised a hierarchical clustering machine learning model for enhanced identification of duplicate data, reducing record preprocessing time and improving data accuracy
    - Engaged in cross-functional collaboration to orchestrate planning, development, and integration of actionable items.

- **QA & Automation Intern - Illuminating Software**
    - Formulated and integrated automated test scripts with C# and Selenium, enhancing performance and functionality testing under test-driven development principles, facilitating error detection by 35%.
    - Conducted comprehensive manual and automated QA analysis to ensure reliable and robustness prior to deployment.
    - Diagnosed and resolved critical technical issues within the development codebase, contributing to the development of new testing utilities.

### Projects

- ## Generative ASL ##
    - An ongoing project to help make web content more accessible to the ASL communinity. The process has consisted of architecting a cloud pipeline that receives text transcriptions as input data and converts the transcriptions to 
    ASL gloss. The gloss generations are then mapped to avatar pose estimations
    to create a 3D avatar that performs ASL overlaid onto the original video or audio content.

- ## Annual U.S. Healthcare cost anaylsis
    - An in-depth analysis of U.S. Healthcare costs across households
    using survey panel data in an effort to discover important factors
